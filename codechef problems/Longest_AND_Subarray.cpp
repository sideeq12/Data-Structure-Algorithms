// CodeChef October challenge-2021 Division 3 (Rated)
// problem name :  ANDSUBAR 

/* problem statement:
You are given an integer N. Consider the sequence containing the integers 1,2,â€¦,N in increasing order (each exactly once). 
Find the length of the longest subarray in this sequence such that the bitwise AND of all elements in the subarray is positive.
*/

//input: 7   output: 4
/*explaination : It is optimal to take the subarray [4,5,6,7] 
and the bitwise AND of all integers in this subarray is 4
*/

//input: 4  output: 2
/*It is optimal to take the subarray [2,3]
 and the bitwise AND of 2 and 3 is 2.
