/* Problem Description */

/*
    Consider a network consisting of n computers and m connections. 
    Each connection specifies how fast a computer can send data to another computer.

    Kotivalo wants to download some data from a server. 
    What is the maximum speed he can do this, using the connections in the network?

*/

/*
    Input:
    The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of computers and connections. 
    The computers are numbered 1,2,â€¦,n. Computer 1 is the server and computer n is Kotivalo's computer.

    After this, there are m lines describing the connections. 
    Each line has three integers a, b and c: computer a can send data to computer b at speed c.

    Output:
    Print one integer: the maximum speed Kotivalo can download data.

    Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 500
    1 <= m <= 1000
    1 <= a,b <= n
    1 <= c <= 10^9
*/

/*
    Example test case:

    Sample Input:
    4 5
    1 2 3
    2 4 2
    1 3 4
    3 4 5
    4 1 3

    Sample Output:
    6
